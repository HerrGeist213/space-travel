## The Objective
This extra credit project was assigned to me through the Computer Coach Front-end Developer course as part of the CSS Digital Badge Challenge. It is also one of the selections for the Bonus Portfolio Projects portion of the curriculum, so I dediced to kill two birds with one code.

## What I Learned
We were given a link to the Scrimba course, so it was more or less a code-along project. However, the Technology section was left completely up to the student to figure out. This was definitely a challenge and it really helped me understand a few things that I did not understand about responsive layouts, media queries, proper use of CSS variables, and JavaScript. I was pretty inexperienced with JS when I started this project a few weeks ago, but now that we have entered the JS portion of the Computer Coach curriculum, everything was a lot easier while I finished everything up.

## The Challenges

1. Responsive Layout
1. CSS Variables
1. JavaScript

**Building the responsive layout** wasn't as difficult as I anticipated, but I did have some trouble along the way. I referred back to the training from Computer Coach more than once in order to figure certain things out. Even with Kevin Powell's instructions, I was having difficulty understanding. I don't know that code-along is the best teaching method for me, but figuring things out on my own is always a winner.

**Implementing CSS Variables** is actually a lot of fun for me, so this part was fairly easy. There's just something about an anchored point of referrence that helps me keep things organized and clean. That appeals to my OCD in a big way. Variables will be a favorite of mine for the rest of my coding days, I can tell.

**JavaScript** seems like it will be completely logical and easy once I get a solid grasp of what all the commands do, but right now it is still a challenge. I was happy to complete this project and have everything working, but I will be focusing a lot of energy on nailing down JS moving forward.

## My Conlusion

This was an excellent and challenging project, even with the step-by-step instructions. I'm 99% sure I've done everything correctly here, but I'm looking forward to any pointers or critiques coming my way.
